# Tip Calculator Swift

This is an iOS app that calculates tip and total amount for a bill and lets the user select tip percentage and set a default tip percentage.

*Time spent:* 7 hours

*Completed user stories:*
* [x] Required: Basic tip calculator app
* [x] Required: Settings view for the app
* [x] Optional: Remembering bill amount across app restarts (for 10 minutes)
* [x] Optional: Using locale specific currency and currency thousand separators
* [x] Optional:  Light/dark color for settings view

*Notes:*

This was my first iOS app, so it took some time to figure out user defaults and syntax. The intro to swift video, app video walk through and hints page were very helpful.

*Walkthrough of all user stories:*
