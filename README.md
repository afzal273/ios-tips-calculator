This is an iOS app that calculates tip and total amount for a bill and lets the user select tip percentage and set a default tip percentage.\

*Time spent:* 7 hours\
\
*Completed user stories:*\
* [x] Required: Basic tip calculator app\

\
*Notes:*\
\
This was my first iOS app, so it took some time to figure out user defaults and syntax. The intro to swift video, app video walk through and hints page were very helpful.\
